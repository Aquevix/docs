When you're running a mission critical website, whether it is yours or your client's, you need to have the right information available to you immediately.

Section.io runs a real-time logging and metrics platform to provide you with the diagnostics you need.

DevOps teams need a few things to get their job done well:

* **Continual improvement**: section.io collects hundreds of metrics about how your HTTP traffic is performing. Long term retenion is available out of the box.
* **Incident detection**: section.io allows you to configure alerts on any metric in the platform.
* **Incident management**: when things go wrong, use the real time metrics to identify problems, and then dig right into the HTTP logs to isolate individual requests.

Legacy CDNs fall short of these needs in a couple of ways. Either their log shipping latency is too slow (sometimes an hour after your problem started), or by ignoring the need to process those logs into meaningful and actionable information.

Section.io also makes sure that these metrics and logs datasources are made available in familiar formats, so you can integrate them into your existing operational toolchain. Use your existing monitoring stack to get alerts, without "yet another alerting platform".
