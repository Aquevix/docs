section.io realigns the CDN promises into a modern Application Edge system.

By focusing on putting architects, developers and sysadmins in the driver's seat, teams are able to get superior outcomes for application performance, availability, scalability and security.

section.io differs from contemporary CDN platforms by:

* allowing a choice of reverse proxy technology.
* allowing engineers to use normal tooling to configure the system.
* providing a real time devops toolset.

This differs from legacy CDN approaches:

* **there is no "one size fits all"**. Legacy CDNs have a single architecture that may, or may not, suit your architecture today and tomorrow.
* **there is no "push and pray"**. With full integration into the development lifecycle you know, on your laptop, that things will work before go-live.
* **there is no "visibility gap"**. Legacy CDNs are slow to deliver diagnostics, and offer no analytics tools to turn raw data into actionable insight.

section.io is ready to handle your workload, whether you have a single large site or many large sites.
