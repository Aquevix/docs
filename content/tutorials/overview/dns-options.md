section.io uses DNS to route requests to the most appropriate datacenter.

When you sign up for section.io, you configure a CNAME record to point your traffic to our Application Edge, just like a legacy CDN.

section.io also includes a global anycast DNS network with all plans. This can be useful if you run your site as a bare domain.

Whilst you can choose to move your DNS to our nameservers, that's completely optional at all plan levels.
