Section.io can handle a single web site, or many web sites very easily.

If you work at an agency, you'll realize there are specific challenges when handling many web sites.

When you work at an agency, you need to be able to:

* log in with one user account for yourself, and see all your client sites.
* give logins to individual clients, so that they can see only their data and not your other clients.
* bill your customers independently, so that you don't have to think about how much to charge each client.

Section.io's account structure is set up to do just that.

Each site that runs on [section.io's Application Edge runs on a Global Network]({{< relref "tutorials/overview/global-network.md">}}).
