# User Security

*A guide for securing your user access.*

## Two-factor authentication

section.io recommends you use a strong password that is not shared with any other services but we also allow your login to be optionally secured by a second factor.

You can enable two-factor authentication (2FA) from the **My Info** link under the **Account** section of the Aperture Portal navigation menu.

Upon enabling 2FA, it is immediately active for all future logins. By default your user account will be enrolled to receive 2FA codes via SMS to the Phone Number saved in your profile so please ensure it is correct.

Alternatively you can choose to "store my code on a device" which will instead use a Time-based One-time Password (RFC 6238) which is compatible with the Google Authenticator app available for most smartphones. When selecting this option you will be presented with QR code that you can scan with your phone's 2FA app.

If you contact section.io support we can enforce 2FA to be required for all users invited to your account.
